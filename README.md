# Data Science Project on Water Polo Champions League Data  

This project applies fundamental principles of data science to analyze data from the **2022/2023 LEN Water Polo Champions League**. The project focuses on data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization to derive meaningful insights and conclusions.  

## Overview  

The project utilizes **Python** in a Jupyter Notebook environment to implement core data science techniques. Key tools and libraries include:  
- **Selenium**: For automated data collection from the LEN Champions League website.  
- **import_ipynb**: To modularize and import helper Jupyter Notebooks into the main file.  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.  
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization.  

### Data Source  
The dataset was obtained using Selenium to scrape data from the official LEN Champions League website. The data focuses on the 2022/2023 season for completeness, as the 2023/2024 season was ongoing during the analysis.  

### Workflow  

1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Automated the data scraping process using Selenium.  
   - Saved the raw data in a `.csv` file.  

2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Processed and cleaned the dataset to ensure consistency and usability.  
   - Removed redundant and irrelevant information.  

3. **Data Analysis**:  
   - Performed statistical analysis to identify trends and patterns.  
   - Derived actionable insights to support water polo teams in improving performance.  

4. **Notebook Modularization**:  
   - Leveraged `import_ipynb` to import helper notebooks for better workflow organization.  
   - Centralized all processing in the `Main.ipynb` notebook.  

5. **Visualization**:  
   - Created comprehensive diagrams and charts to illustrate findings.  

6. **Problem-Solving**:  
   - Documented challenges encountered during the project.  
   - Explained solutions implemented to address these challenges.  

## Results  

The project delivers:  
- **Tables**: Presenting the processed data.  
- **Diagrams**: Highlighting results and key patterns.  
- **Conclusions**: Explaining the importance of the data and how it can help improve team performance in water polo.  

## Key Learnings  

- **Data Insights**: Demonstrated the importance of using complete, clean datasets for analysis.  
- **Visualization**: Used clear visual representations to support conclusions.  
- **Practical Applications**: Showed how data can guide strategic improvements for water polo teams.
